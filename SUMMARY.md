**UAV Small Object Detection (UAVOD-10)** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the small weak objects detection and drone inspection domains, and in the geospatial research. The dataset presented here is not the original one. Learn more on the dataset's homepage.

The dataset consists of 844 images with 18334 labeled objects belonging to 10 different classes including *building*, *prefabricated-house*, *well*, and other: *cable-tower*, *vehicle*, *ship*, *quarry*, *cultivation-mesh-cage*, *pool*, and *landslide*.

Images in the UAV Small Object Detection (UAVOD-10) dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (43 images), *train* (717 images), and *valid* (84 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the China University of Geosciences.
